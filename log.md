# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've reversed sorted by date order the log below. I've also adopted ISO8601 date formats for consistency. 

### Day 4: 2017-Jan-05 

**Today's Progress**: Tidied a litte code. Worked on getting the Git files sorted and pushing those to the repo below. Also forked and published this repo.

**Thoughts** Unsettled by being thrown into VI editor for the first time since about 1998! Please that I've created a first public version. 

**Link(s) to work**
You can find the project on my [Github Repo](https://github.com/watty62/SRPPM)

### Day 3: 2017-Jan-04 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my railways data scraper in Python.  Strung all test progs together into one combined programme. Archived the test scripts. the combined programme worked straight off. Will push v1 to github tomorrow, I promise.

**Thoughts** Pleased that the parts of the programme came together without issue.

### Day 2: 2017-Jan-03

**Today's Progress**: I signed up for the PDFTables API (see Day 1). I got the PDF to CSV conversion via API working. Now it retrieves a CSV file and saves that. I created an initial data extraction from CSV but it is still quite rough.

**Thoughts**: I chose CSV as, having tested the alternative file formats that the API returns, it seems easier to work with than XSLX or XML in this case due to the weird format of the original PDF. 

### Day 1: 2017-Jan-02

**Today's Progress**: Started my first #100DaysOfCode project today. Its purpose is to create to make railway performance data available as open data and over time. To do that, I need to scrape PDFs, extract data via [PDFTables](http://twitter.com/@pdftables) and put that into #SQLITE database, and finally visualise it. I might try to create an API too. I got the first part started. Found the target link on the page, followed it, grabbed the name of the PDF, stored that, and downloaded the PDF itself.

**Thoughts:** Having been doing no coding for what feels like years (but is more like months) it feels good to be back working on a project. This builds on the [four Coursera python courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) I studied over xmas and New Year.
