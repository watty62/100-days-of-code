# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017-Jan-02

**Today's Progress**: Started my first #100days of code project today. Its purpose is to create to make railway performance data availabel as open data and over time. To do that I need to scrape PDFs, extract data via [PDFTables](http://twitter.com/@pdftables) and put that into #SQLITE database, and finally visualise it. I might try to create an API too. I got the first part started. Found the target link on the page, folled it. Grabbed the name of the PDF, stored that, and downloaded the PDF itself.

**Thoughts:** Having been doing no coding for what feels like years (but is more like months) it feels good to be back working on a project. This builds on the four Coursera python courses I studied over xmas and New Year. 

### Day 2: 2017-Jan-03

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for the PDF Tables API. I got the PDF to CSV conversion via API working. Now it retrieves a CSV. Initial data extraction from CSV done but rough.

**Thoughts**: I chose CSV as, having tested the alternative file formats that the API returns, it seems easier to work with than XSLX or XML in this case due to the weird format of the original PDF. 

### Day 3: 2017-Jan-04 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my railways data scraper in Python.  Strung all test progs together into one combined programme. Archived the test scripts. and worked straight off. Will push v1 to github tomorrow, I promise.

**Thoughts** Please that the parts of the programme came together without issue.
